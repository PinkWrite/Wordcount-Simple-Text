# PinkWrite 99
*A typing box for learning composition*

This slimmed-down text editor is imported from the [PinkWrite Client](https://github.com/PinkWrite/PinkWrite-Client), but slightly rearranged and includes no-paste, no-cheat features for classroom use from [PinkWrite 88](https://github.com/PinkWrite/88)

Teachers, tutors, parents, and other educators can use this to ensure that students focus on learning content and core skill.

This is intended for use after [PinkWrite 88](https://github.com/PinkWrite/88).

This can be convenient on slimmed-down platforms, such as Chrome.

While most browsers will suffice, Chrome is preferrable because it has no "Save" dialog.

**Instructions:**

- Disable spell-check in the web browser
- Word count appears below the large, resizable text area
- Enter a file name in the empty text bar just above the "Finish" button
- Click "Finish" to save the content to the default "Downloads" folder.
